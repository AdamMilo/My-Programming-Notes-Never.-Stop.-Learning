# My-Programming-Notes
These are personal programming notes from the various courses, classes, documentation pages and articles. 
They are comprised of tutorials, components, obesrvations and special considerations derived from sound advice, instruction and tutoring as well personal insight from my practice projects. 

In short, it is my custom 'web development intro' reference documentation.

 Never. Stop. Learning.
